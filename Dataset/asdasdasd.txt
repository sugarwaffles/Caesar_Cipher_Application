Using a key of 5 we have recovered the plaintext "marcus crassus", another high powered contempory of Julius Caesar. It is very unlikely that another key will produce a second plaintext that makes sense, so we can assume that this is the correct plaintext (although, with a computer it would not take long to check the remaining 20 possibilities).
There are two dificulties with this method. The first is that we were lucky in our example above, that we only had to do the decryption 5 times, but it is equally likely that a key of 24 could have been used, and then the time to perform the breaking of the code would be substantial. This is a problem that has been largely overcome by the invention of computers, which can perform all 26 possible calculations in a matter of seconds.
The second problem with the above method is that the message intercepted could be longer than two words, and hence performing each decryption could take a significant amount of time. The way around this is fairly simple, and that is to just look at the first two or three words of the intercept, and perform the calculations on these. You will still find the key, by finding the key that deciphers those words into a meaningful phrase, and can then use the key to decrypt the rest of the message as you would if you had known the key to start with.
This method of breaking the Shift Cipher is rather cumbersome, but can be useful if you know that it has been used. However, in reality it is unlikely that as an interceptor you would know which cipher has been used. There is a general method for attacking all monoalphabetic ciphers called frequency analysis, which is discussed later.
