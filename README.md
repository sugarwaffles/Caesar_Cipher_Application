Data Structures and Algorithms - Caesar Cipher Analyzer

Overview of the system 
Your job is to implement a Caesar Cipher(*) Encrypted Message Analyzer Application
The application will serve the following three purposes:
1. It will allow a user to encrypt and decrypt messages typed on the screen or read 
from files.
2. It will allow a user to analyze letter frequencies distributions and use that to infer 
an (unknown) Caesar cipher key from an encrypted file.
3. It will allow the user to analyze and sort multiple Caesar encrypted files that are 
stored in a folder.

A Caesar Cipher is a special instance of a substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 
replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down (or up) the alphabet. Take note, you can read 
more on Caesar Cipher at Wikipedia.
